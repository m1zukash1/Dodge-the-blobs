# Note
I collaborated with three colleagues on this project, but it should be noted that I contributed the majority of the work. My teammates were newcomers to programming and were unfamiliar with using a game development framework. Despite these challenges, our project was awarded the highest possible evaluation and was recognized as the best in our group.
